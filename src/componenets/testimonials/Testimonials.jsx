    review: 'Working with Jason, it was clear that he brought a unique combination of technical nuance, curiosity, and initiative. Having demonstrated his ability to create positive leverage from day one, Jason became a fundamental part of the team, owning a work stream while simultaneously stepping in to fill our growing startupâ€™s needs wherever they arose. In a world in which the bridges we can draw between the technical and the human increasingly become our greatest assets, Jason contributes in a way that would make any employer lucky to have him. '

    review: <p>Jason's passion for engineering, combined with his great teaching abilities, made him a standout mentor. He consistently demonstrated a high level of professionalism and work ethic, earning my trust quickly as well as the respect of other mentors and  his mentees. I wholeheartedly recommend Jason for any engineering position, confident that he will be a valuable asset to any organization fortunate enough to have him on their team.</p>
